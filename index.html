    <h2>Adan the King Pug was born on 2nd June but his birthday will be 10th July.He is a male Fron coloured pug. He is
        my First dog and also the first
        dog in my Family.He is a pure breed pug and is more active and playful than a Labra.He has blue eyes and loves
        his Owner(i.e. Adit Sarda). Whenever someone ignores him , he uses puppy eyes & hipnotizes everyone with it.
        He loves to play with his Owner games like Fetch, Tug of War etc. He gets Ultra energetic when he listens to
        Music.
